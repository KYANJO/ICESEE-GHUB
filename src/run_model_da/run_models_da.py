# ==============================================================================
# @desc: Entry point for running ICESEE data assimilation (EnKF variants) with:
#   • mode="full"    → Fully parallelized workflow: parallel batch file creation
#                      (serial/parallel), parallel I/O via both h5py and Zarr,
#                      memory-optimized routines, and a fully parallel analysis step.
#                      Intended for large models and datasets.
#   • mode="partial" → Partially parallelized workflow: parallel I/O but only rank 0
#                      writes; the analysis vector X5 is computed on rank 0 and
#                      broadcast to all ranks. State vectors are scattered for local
#                      dot products (StateVec · X5) and gathered for the analysis update.
#                      Suited to small/medium models.
#   • mode="serial"  → Single-process execution. Useful for small/experimental models
#                      and testing serial EnKF variants (DEnKF, EnKF, EnTKF, and EnRSKF,
#                      with adaptive localization.
#
# Notes:
#   - Parallel I/O supports both HDF5 (h5py/mpi) and Zarr backends.
#   - Exactly one mode must be chosen per run.
