# ICESEE on GHUB

This GHUB tool packages ICESEE into an interactive **Jupyter Book** format, so users can explore the framework, run lightweight examples, and understand the workflow without needing to set up a full HPC environment.

## What ICESEE is designed to do

ICESEE supports ensemble data assimilation workflows (e.g., EnKF-style methods) with an emphasis on:

- **Modular structure** so you can reuse the same DA logic across different models
- **Model coupling** (including external codes/workflows) while keeping the assimilation engine consistent
- **Scalability** toward HPC and cloud-style execution, including GHUB-style environments

For implementation details and broader documentation, see the
[ICESEE Wiki](https://github.com/ICESEE-project/ICESEE/wiki).

## What you can do in this GHUB book

This book is organized to help you:

1. **Understand the ICESEE workflow** (ensembles, observations, forecasts, and analysis steps)
2. **Run a minimal, self-contained DA example** (Lorenz-96) to validate the environment and illustrate the full cycle
3. **Learn how ICESEE connects to larger ice-sheet models** (e.g., ISSM, Icepack) at a high level, including typical setup requirements

## How ICESEE is integrated here

This GHUB-facing repository (**ICESEE-GHUB**) is a wrapper around the main ICESEE codebase:

- The ICESEE source is pinned from the **ICESEE main branch** for reproducibility while tracking upstream progress
- The Jupyter Book provides documentation and runnable notebooks that rely on that pinned version

---

## Notes on dependencies

Some ICESEE components run with standard scientific Python packages, while others require external modeling stacks (e.g., full ice-sheet model toolchains). This GHUB book prioritizes **lightweight and portable** examples, and clearly separates:

- **Runs directly in GHUB** (Lorenz-96 DA demo)
- **Requires external installations** (ISSM / Icepack workflows)
